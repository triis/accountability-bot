# accountability-bot

Bot for staying accountable and not being distracted by Discord. 

I plan to eventually re-write the bot in TypeScript, if possible.


# Feature ideas:

- Being able to mute yourself for specific amount of time.
- Setting goals with timed reminders.
- Not muting but restricting messages (muting if you are too active).
- Adding an accountability partner that will additionally be reminded to keep an eye on you.
- (Not sure if this one is possible), keeping an eye on status (offline, online, etc).
- Monitor across servers.
- Help command
- Will probably use emoji reactions for management.
